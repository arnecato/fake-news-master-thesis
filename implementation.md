# Baseline single-objective NSA
Similar to work done in (Ripon et al., n.d.)by Ripon et al.
Objective 1: Maximizing RR
Setting RR next to nearest self (incl other detectors)
5-fold training and test set 75%/25% and measure:

1. Avg. precision
2. Avg. recall

# Multi-objective NSA without feature selection
Objective 1: Maximizing RR

Objective 2: Minimizing overlap with self (incl. other detectors)

Full feature vectors used.

5-fold training and test set 75%/25% and measure:
1. Avg. precision
2. Avg. recall

# Multi-objective NSA with feature selection and VLC
Same as above, except with embedded feature selection and variable-length chromosome method.
Detector encoding has variable length. Selects which subset of features to use in the detector, e.g. [49,355,1433,254]. Mutation and recombination operators will add and subtract feature subsets.

5-fold training and test set 75%/25% and measure:
1. Avg. precision
2. Avg. recall

# Algorithm
1. Initialize new antibody population. 0.5 of them randomly, 0.5 of them based on an antigen position. Set RR to border of closest self.
2. Evolve antibodies with feature values and RR:
    - Maximize RR
    - Minimize overlap between Antibody ab and antigen ag and ab and mature antibody mab (penalizing self sample overlap more than mature detector):
$$ùëÇ=(1+Œ£Overlapab, ag)^2+(1+Œ£Overlapab, mab)‚àí2$$

3. MO convergence based on diversity or spacing TBD.
4. Evaluate F1-score of mature detector set on training dataset. Let precision and recall guide weighting between objectives for selecting new detector from pareto-front of MO run. E.g if lower recall than precision, emphasize picking a new detector by weighting objective 1 (RR and coverage) higher. Use softmax to get weight from precision and recall metrics. If no mature detector yet, then weight 0.5/0.5 between objectives.
5. New detector must have no overlap with self samples.
6. Find F1-score of mature detector set with new detector
7. on validation set:
    - If F1 has not converged yet: Go back to 1 and re-initialize population to evolve new detector
    - If converged: record best F1 score achieved on validation set
